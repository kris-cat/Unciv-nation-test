        "startIntroPart1": "Greetings to the wise and brave Prince William of Orange, who freed the Netherlands and gave strength to the Dutch people. In 1568, you led a rebellion against Spanish dominion, to gain freedom for your people, and therefore starting the Eighty Years' War. Your actions were all aimed to create one of Europe's first modern republics, the Seven United Provinces. The rebellion was the meaning of your very life and death, as it was also the cause of your assassination in 1584. But your death has given even more pride and courage to your people, to fight for liberty against any oppressors. Carved in history as the 'Father of the Fatherland', your name is a symbol of Dutch independence for eternity.",
